**Note:** This is a demonstration project. For production use, please ensure proper security measures and API key management.

## Setup with Poetry or uv (preferred)

- __Poetry__
  - Install: `pipx install poetry`
  - Install deps: `poetry install`
  - Run: `poetry run python start.py`

- __uv__
  - Install: `pipx install uv`
  - Create venv: `uv venv`
  - Install deps: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Run: `uv run python start.py`

Note: This repo currently includes `requirements.txt` for convenience, but Poetry/uv are the preferred tooling.

## Optional: Convex logging integration

This project can log requests/responses to a Convex backend if configured.

- __Configure environment__ in `.env` (see `.env.example`):
  - `CONVEX_URL=https://<your>.convex.cloud`
  - `CONVEX_ADMIN_KEY=...` (preferred for server) or `CONVEX_TOKEN=...`

- __Install Python client__ (already referenced in `requirements.txt`): `convex`

- __Create a Convex project__ (Node 18+, NPM):
  - `npm create convex@latest`
  - `npm install`

- __Define schema__ at `convex/schema.ts`:
```ts
import { defineSchema, defineTable, v } from "convex/schema";

export default defineSchema({
  logs: defineTable({
    timestamp: v.number(),
    version: v.string(),
    context: v.any(),
    response: v.any(),
  }).index("by_timestamp", ["timestamp"]),
});
```

- __Add mutation__ at `convex/logs.ts`:
```ts
import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const addApology = mutation({
  args: {
    timestamp: v.number(),
    version: v.string(),
    context: v.any(),
    response: v.any(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const id = await ctx.db.insert("logs", args);
    return { id };
  },
});
```

- __Run Convex locally__:
  - `npx convex dev` (requires login and project setup)

- __Python side__:
  - `apology_agents/peace_agent.py` will best-effort call `client.mutation("logs:addApology", payload)` when env vars are present. Failures are ignored so your main flow is not impacted.

Security: Do not log sensitive content. Admin keys must not be exposed client-side.
